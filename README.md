# Personalised Assistant for the field agent

Artoo’s mobile users are field agents (FA) working for financial institutions. They spend a lot of time in the field sourcing leads and collecting data at the doorstep of the borrower. The goal is to reduce manual data entry

## Scenario 1
When he meets a lead he will collect basic profile information like name, mobile number (and geo-location if possible). It is also possible that he gets a lead information over a call or as a referral from his colleagues or manager

### Task 1
Create a lead based on a phone call (TrueCaller style)
Bonus: Create a lead using OCR of the business card


## Scenario 2
Since prospective borrowers are scattered all over the city and they are busy running their business. Hence it is vital that the FA is able to effectively manage his day. Some leads will show interest but they would ask the FA to call/meet later on a specific date / time / location. The FA has to capture these details so he can remember to follow-up later
### Task 2
Enable reminders for follow-up tasks based on date, time and location


## Scenario 3
The FA then collects photos of the customer’s KYC and Business Proofs. 
### Task 3
Optimise and show the images in a scrollable gallery. Sync all the photos with the data captured to a firebase DB. Remember that you need to design the system to be offline first
